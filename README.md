## Overview

Site created for a friend of mine who is the manager of an amateur football club. He was finding it time consuming to manually manage match registrations, update the player league table and keep all members informed of club activities.

## Planning

Meeting with club manager to ascertain requirements.  
Project created with Kanban template on Github
26 User Stories added to initial board
Word document created to break down user stories into tasks
Set up views / urls / templates in club app folder
Added member model
Added member zone
Set up base html and base css
Add navbar and footer to base html

## Structure

## Features

## Navigation
I created a responsive navbar that collapses on mobile devices using Bootstrap classes.  The items displayed on the navbar change according to whether the user is logged in or not and whether they are the club manager.

### General User Access
Visitors to the site can view general information about the club.  They also have the option of signing up to the club or logging in if they are a member.

### Member Access
Once a user has logged in their logged in status is displayed on the right of the navbar. Logged in users have access to the member zone in which they can book a place in the next match, view details of the next fixture, view past results and view the player league table.

### Manager Access
As well as all of the member facilities, the manager has access to a dropdown management menu.  This offers options for him to add a new match fixture, update details of the existing matches and approve and remove members.

## Footer
The footer contains social media links to Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.  The club manager has not yet set up accounts with these sites so the links currently take the user to the home page. These links will be updated once the club's accounts have been created.

## Home Page
The home page is split into three sections, accessible by a dropdown menu, a general introduction to the club, a social section and a contact section including a Google map showing where the team play.

## Map
I used the Bootstrap Resume walkthrough project as a guide to creating the JavaScript code to link to the Google Maps API.  At the moment only one location is marked as the club both play and socialise at the South Park grounds.  I decided to still use marker clusters as the club manager mentioned to me that he may like to add other venues to the map in the future

### Fixture Updates
The Manager is able to add, cancel and edit the next match fixture details


### Team Selection
A maximum of 12 members per week can play. Once 12 people have registered a function is called to allocated players to either the blue or the white team as follows: 
The registered players are sorted in descending order according to their current points.
If 2 or members have the same number of points, they are then ranked according to the number of matches with players with  the fewest number of matches played ranking higher
The eams assigned according to the players' position in the sorted list:
Blues: 1, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12
Whites: 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11
Once assignment has occurred the next fixture details are be updated with the team details.



### Match Results
The manager has the ability to manually enter the latest match score.
The winning team gets 3 points, the losing team 0 points and in the case of a draw each team receives 1 point.
Players automatically inherit their teamâ€™s points once the scores have been input by the manager
The league table automatically updates the player scores and resorts the players.
The scores areautomatically populated in the latest results table


## Bugs and Challenges
Linking to specific sections of a page[linking](https://engineertodeveloper.com/a-better-way-to-route-back-to-a-section-ids-in-django/)


Issues when testing deployment mid project were resolved with the help of Alan at tutor support who identified that my requirements.txt did not contain all of my dependencies.  Solved by freezing the requirements.txt file again.

I had several problems when trying to customize the standard allauth signup form and create the ClubMember model. Each time I ran a migration I was getting an error message.  The original message informed me 

book match place not working. implemented manual test driven approach, gradually increasing functionality

mambers page throwing an error if next fixture was not flagged. added try block
