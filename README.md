## Overview

Site created for a friend of mine who is the manager of an amateur football club. He was finding it time consuming to manually manage match registrations, update the player league table and keep all members informed of club activities.

## Planning

Meeting with club manager to ascertain requirements.  
Project created with Kanban template on Github
26 User Stories added to initial board
Word document created to break down user stories into tasks
Set up views / urls / templates in club app folder
Added member model
Added member zone
Set up base html and base css
Add navbar and footer to base html
